# Fixes in routes-checker for London Control
A pretty simple python script that I've (with some help of AI), has written.
The goal of this script is to help those who are creating custom FIRs to find missing fixes in:
- coded.txt
- airways.txt
- and other similar files to coded.txt

## Fixes.txt
Just copy and paste your whole fixes.ini file in here.

## Airways.txt
Copy the part of routes.ini here containing your airways. 
Unfortunatly there's no functionality for SIDs and STARs yet. 

## Coded.txt
Just copy and paste your whole coded.ini file in here.

## Running the program
Make sure that you have python downloaded on your computer first.
Open the terminal and type:
```
cd [your directory of the files]
python main.py
```

## Output
The result of the everything will be sent in output.txt.
If you wish to run the program again, make sure to clear output.txt first.
